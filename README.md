Smart Healthcare Monitoring System in IoT Cloud

:globe_with_meridians:The Internet of Things (IoT) is essential in innovative applications such as smart cities,
smart homes, education, healthcare, transportation, and defense operations. IoT 
applications are particularly beneficial for providing healthcare because they enable secure
and real-time remote patient monitoring to improve the quality of people’s lives. This
review paper explores the latest trends in healthcare-monitoring systems by implementing 
the role of the IoT. The work discusses the benefits of IoT-based healthcare systems
with regard to their significance, and the benefits of IoT healthcare. We provide a 
systematic review on recent studies of IoT-based healthcare-monitoring systems through
literature review. The literature review compares various systems’ effectiveness,efficiency, data protection, privacy, security, and monitoring. 
The paper also explores wireless- and wearable-sensorbased IoT monitoring systems and provides a classification of healthcare-monitoring sensors. We also elaborate, in detail, on the challenges
and open issues regarding healthcare security and privacy, and QoS. Finally, 
suggestions and recommendations for IoT healthcare applications are laid down at the end of
the study along with future directions related to various recent technology trends.

:technologist:
Our project is a working model which incorporates sensors to measure parameters
like body temperature, heart beat rate.An Arduino microcontroller board is used for
analyzing the inputs from the patient Temperature, heartbeat. 

:hospital:
This project provides a device which will continuously monitor the vital parameters to be monitored for
a patient.If any critical situation arises in a patient, this unit also raises an alarm.
This is very useful for future analysis and review of patient’s health condition. For
more versatile medical applications, this project can be improvised, by incorporating
dental sensors and annunciation systems, thereby making it useful in hospitals as a
very efficient and dedicated patient care system. In recent years, the world is facing a
common problem that the number of elderly people is increasing. Hence, the problem of
home-care for elderly people is very important.In this,IoT is becoming a major platform
for many services applications, also using Node MCU not just as a sensor node but
also a controller here. Paper proposes a generic health monitoring system as a step
forward to the progress made in this department till now.
